# Multi-Language Linking Experiment

This project is an experiment in linking and calling code across multiple programming languages.

It demonstrates how to:
- Call an Assembly function from C (counting primes up to a number)
- Call a Rust function from C (counting pairs of primes that sum to a number)
- Call a Go function from C (counting pairs of Fibonacci numbers that sum to a number)

The goal is to explore interoperability between C, Assembly, Rust, and Go in a single project.

## Build & Run

Make sure you have the required tools installed:
- GCC
- NASM
- Rust (`cargo`)
- Go

Then run:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

## Notes

This is an experimental project for learning and demonstration purposes.
